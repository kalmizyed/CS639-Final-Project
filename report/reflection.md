# Reflection & Future Work

This project taught me a lot about classical computer vision and how to coordinate kinematics and planning to create useful motions in a manipulator.  Using a finite state machine made the conceptual side of development much simpler since I was able to implement and update each state independently without breaking the rest of the system.

Over the course of development, I ran into many issues with the underlying kinematics and planning implementations that made me change course.  For example, I had trouble generating inverse kinematics for a position that was too far from the current one, and neither my planning nor kinematics implementations took collisions into account, so I had to manually tune the positions of the belts and the positions the manipulator would move towards during certain steps of the state machine carefully in order to reduce the failure rate.

Opportunities for future work include speeding up or optimizing the robot’s trajectory generation to increase the acceptable frequency of objects, accounting for collisions, adding multiple drop sites depending on the type of object grabbed, overhauling the computer vision techniques to allow the robot to recognize a greater variety of objects under a larger range of environmental and lighting conditions, using more robust techniques to determine objects’ positions more accurately independent of where they are on the camera image, reimplementing the vision aspect entirely so that the camera can face towards the oncoming objects rather than a birds-eye view, and adapting the experimental setup to a real-world environment.
